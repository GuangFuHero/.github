## 🦸 About Us

While many people can physically go to disaster areas to volunteer, we are a group of **"remote volunteers" and "keyboard volunteers"** who cannot be on-site but still want to contribute to this land.

We use our collective expertise and actions to build an online information system that supports those on the ground — **"Guangfu Hero"**.

This platform was born from a simple belief: **Even if we're not physically present, we can still connect with each other, reach out, and gather our strength into an embrace.**

## ✨ Key Features

We have launched several features:

### 🧭 Volunteer Guide
Organized pre-arrival information for new volunteers, including check-in procedures, transportation details, equipment recommendations, and teams and local communities to join.

### 🗺️ Volunteer Map
Integrated locations of medical stations, supply stations, restrooms, and other facilities in the disaster area to help volunteers quickly familiarize themselves with the environment.

### 💬 Needs Matching Platform
Disaster victims can directly register their needs, and volunteers can view and respond to support requests in real-time, making assistance more efficient.

### 🐝 Bee Delivery System
A team of motorcycle volunteers called "Little Bees" handles supply distribution. After disaster victims submit their needs, Little Bees can pick up supplies from supply stations and deliver them directly.
